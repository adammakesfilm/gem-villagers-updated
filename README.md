# Gem Villagers Updated

This is a maintained version of the Gem Villagers for version 1.21+ as the Vanilla Tweaks team has chosen to no longer develop it. 

It does not use the original gems that the VT version did, instead it follows the style of the VT Wandering Trades Pack where each trade costs 1 emerald and the block your getting a mini version of, and you get 8 heads back. 

## Vanilla Tweaks  Team:
