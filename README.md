# Gem Villagers Updated

This is an updated version of [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/)' Gem Villagers datapack that includes all the mini blocks that are in their Wandering Trades datapack. It does not, however, include the Hermit Heads villager. 

You will still need the Treasure Gems datapack to use this datapack. Get it from https://vanillatweaks.net/

**This is updated to match Wandering Trades version 1.6.0**
